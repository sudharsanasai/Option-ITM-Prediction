Isaac Benbenisti,0,"Thank you. Good day, everyone, and welcome to our Earning Conference Call. The third quarter of 2018 results reflect encouraging figures in the cellular segment as well as the momentum in the company's new growth engine, TV and fiber optic infrastructure. In the cellular segment, we added 11,000 postpaid subscribers to our subscriber base on a net basis, along with growth in ARPU and decline in churn rates. This is the 13th consecutive quarter in growth in the number of postpaid subscribers.
The growth in households connected to the Partner TV has accelerated during the third quarter, and as of today, Partner TV has 118,000 households connected to the service. Most of Partner TV's customers choose the service as part of a package, bundling TV and Internet services, and some of them are connected to Partner TV using Partner fiber optic infrastructure. Our fiber optics infrastructure, Partner Fiber, which was launched last year, reached over 250,000 households across Israel as of today. Our deployment proceed at a rapid pace, and Partner's optic fibers are available to more and more households who can connect to the Internet service at a speed up to 1,000 megabits per second. The business customer division is expanding as well, and in the third quarter, new customers have joined and existing customer services were expanded. This is attributable to Partner's integration capabilities and strategic collaborations with world-leading manufacturers. In addition, as part of the company strategy, we continue to examine new potential growth engines, among others, in the fintech and finance industries.
I will now like to turn the call over to Tamir Amar for detailed review of our financial results. Tamir, please."
Tamir Amar,0,"Thank you, Isaac. Good day, everyone, and welcome to our Earning Conference Call. The third quarter results reflected the existing trends in the communications market and the progress in the company's strategies and ongoing projects. In the cellular segment, Partner recorded a decrease in churn rates to 8%, and for the 13th consecutive quarter, a net increase in postpaid subscribers as well as a net increase of 8,000 cellular subscribers overall. These results followed the entrance of a new competitor during the second quarter, which resulted in an increase in the churn rate and an intensification on the level of competition in the second quarter 2018. However, this effect was significantly moderated during the third quarter. In the fixed-line segment, adjusted EBITDA increased by 12% in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2017 and by 22% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This growth resulted from continued growth in the number of households connected to Partner TV, which led to an increase in revenues from Internet and TV services.
In addition, we continue to deploy fiber optic to residential areas, reaching over 200,000 households by the end of the third quarter and over 250,000 households as of today. The deployment serves as a platform for the daily transfer of customers to our independent infrastructure, which is expected to significantly improve the profitability of our Internet and TV operations, enables a higher-quality TV viewing experience for Partner's customers and provides an enhanced Internet service. The company's free cash flow totaled ILS 70 million in the third quarter after taking into account all the company's investments, including in the fiber optic and TV, investments which remain relatively stable despite the increase in fiber optics deployment and the significant increase in the number of Partner's TV households.
We succeeded in maintaining net debt at the level of -- at a level below ILS 0.9 billion while continuing the deploy -- the develop new growth engines and execute our buyback plan, which total ILS 67 million during the quarter. Overall, since the company announced its buyback plan in May 2018, we have acquired 6.5 million shares at a total cost of ILS 100 million, including commissions, at an average price of ILS 15.38 per share. 
And now I will be happy to open the call for questions. Moderator, please begin the Q&A."
Operator,1,[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays.
Tavy Rosner,1,"If we could talk first about fiber a little bit. In the past, you mentioned having talks with Cellcom with regards to a potential joint venture, but it's been a while since you gave an update on that, so I was wondering if this is still relevant. And then more generally speaking, if we could have your thoughts on the IBC venture."
Isaac Benbenisti,1,"Okay. I will answer this question in a very strict method. Our aim and our strategy is to deploy in the most efficient way, the most fast -- the fastest way and the cheapest way, the fiber optics in Israel. We prove till now that we have the best machine in Israel internally to deploy these fiber optics. We reached 200 and 500 households in -- 250,000, sorry, households.
No, no, reached -- never mind, okay? And we talk now with Cellcom. If we'll see that the agreement that they have been reached in negotiating with IBC will serve our strategy, we'll join to them and we'll do it together in our internal abilities together with them. But we don't care what is the way to deploy. We will find the best way, the cheapest way and the fastest way to do it in order to cover the country and to provide our OTT services over the best infrastructure in Israel."
Tavy Rosner,1,"Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe if you can share any thoughts about your targeted deployments. Because, for example, the IBC set some numbers out there and we know that Bezeq has a universal coverage obligation. So right now, you pretty much cover 10% of Israeli homes. So did you set yourself a target of how many you would like to reach in your -- at your own pace?"
Isaac Benbenisti,1,"We don't project these numbers. But I can tell you that when you go to such a project, you have to think from the beginning that to be successful, you have to cover a massive -- you have to have massive coverage of the country. So we have our targets. I think that what we have done till now surprised mostly everyone because we achieved it in a very tough year dealing with Bezeq and regulatory issues and so on, so forth. And despite all this, we achieved 250,000 households with our fiber optic project. We'll look to the future, and I think that despite the fact that we do -- we are not obliged to any regulatory deployment, we go in a wide range of countries -- cities in Israel. And we'll continue to do it. And our aim is to gain decent market share in this arena. But we do not project the number, how much we aim to do next year, for instance."
Tavy Rosner,1,"Right. And maybe lastly on that. So I know you guys don't disclose the number of connected homes at this stage. But maybe if you guided us through the general dynamics, you go into the building and you advertise that you have a fiber offering, what has been the customer reaction to it? It's like, do you have them jumping on it saying, ""We want higher speeds."" Or you still have some of them saying, ""You know what, we're comfortable with our existing DSL offering. We don't need extra speed, so we don't want to pay extra."" Do you have any thoughts on that?"
Isaac Benbenisti,1,"Yes, I think that this question relates to the famous story about the egg and the chicken because the -- when we -- as long the way that we expand our coverage, the Israeli customers are aware of this solution. So the pace of connected houses that we actually have increase exponentially. I mean that at the beginning, it was hard because it was a bit difficult to explain what do we mean by 1,000 gigabytes and why the Internet at home now doesn't really serve the OTT. The demand was not there. But when we deployed more and more, we see that the demand increased rapidly. So it goes together in how much we deploy. In the last quarter, we see a massive increase in the number of households that connected to us together with our OTT TV solution."

So thank you very much for doing -- joining us."
